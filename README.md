# library-app
This app stores book info and displays it below with card view. I added button to start a showing a modal box for detail input and stored as an object.
Each card is generated from every input. By using object, I can loop over every property so I do not need to write code to generate element for each info of the book. To remove each card, I added number as data attribute to each card DOM for selection.
